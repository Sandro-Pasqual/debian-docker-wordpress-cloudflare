# Tutorial: Setting Up a Debian 12 Server with Docker, WordPress, MySQL, and Cloudflare

## About This Tutorial
This tutorial is based on a personal project where I faced significant challenges setting up a Debian 12 server with Docker, WordPress, MySQL, and Cloudflare. After struggling for over a month and encountering roadblocks with other AI tools (such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen, which often got stuck in loops), I received invaluable guidance from Grok, created by xAI. Together, we worked step by step to overcome these obstacles, resulting in this detailed guide.

## Prerequisites
- A Debian 12 server (with SSH access as a `user` or another user with sudo privileges).
- A registered domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) configured in Cloudflare.
- Internet access on the server.
